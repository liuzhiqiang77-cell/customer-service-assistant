# Market-Oriented Aircraft Procurement - Reference Guide

## Evaluation Examples

### Example 1: Approved Purchase
**Scenario**: Proposal to acquire new aircraft with improved business class seating, faster turnaround times, and lower operating costs.

**Evaluation**:
- Purchase motivation: Enhance business traveler experience and operational efficiency
- Negative constraints: Not solely for pilot/mechanic comfort ✓
- Business value: Enhanced value to business travelers ✓
- Competitiveness: Lower operating costs and better service make company more competitive ✓
- Strategic alignment: Supports market-oriented focus ✓

**Result**: Purchase Authorized

### Example 2: Rejected Purchase
**Scenario**: Proposal to acquire new aircraft primarily because pilots want updated avionics and mechanics want to work on newer engines.

**Evaluation**:
- Purchase motivation: Pilot comfort and mechanic engagement
- Negative constraints: Sole purpose is pilot/mechanic comfort ✗
- Business value: No demonstrated enhancement to business travelers
- Competitiveness: No competitive advantage demonstrated

**Result**: Request Rejected

### Example 3: Approved Retention of Existing Aircraft
**Scenario**: Proposal to purchase new aircraft vs. retaining older aircraft that perfectly suits the business traveler segment.

**Evaluation**:
- Purchase motivation: Fleet modernization
- Negative constraints: Not solely for pilot/mechanic comfort ✓
- Business value: Older aircraft actually fits service type better
- Competitiveness: Retaining older aircraft maintains competitive positioning for target market
- Strategic alignment: Market-oriented decision based on service fit, not technology

**Result**: Retain Existing Aircraft (Purchase Rejected)

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Technology Focus**: Avoid being swayed by new technology features that don't translate to business value
2. **Operational Pressure**: Resist pressure from pilots or mechanics for new equipment without business justification
3. **Production Mentality**: Don't acquire aircraft just because they're newer or more advanced
4. **Ignoring Strategic Fit**: Ensure aircraft capabilities match the service model being sold

## Key Principles

- **Market Orientation**: Decisions based on customer value, not operational preferences
- **Competitiveness**: Every acquisition must improve competitive position
- **Strategic Alignment**: Aircraft choices must support the business model
- **Value Over Novelty**: Newer isn't always better if it doesn't serve the market
