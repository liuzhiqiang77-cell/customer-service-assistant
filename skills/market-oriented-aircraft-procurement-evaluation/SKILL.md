# Market-Oriented Aircraft Procurement Evaluation

## When to Use
Apply this skill when:
- A proposal to buy new aircraft is initiated
- Making capital expenditure decisions for aircraft acquisition
- Developing or reviewing fleet renewal strategies
- Evaluating whether to retain existing aircraft vs. purchasing new ones

## Prerequisites
Before applying this evaluation, ensure:
- Business value assessment has been conducted
- Competitiveness analysis is available
- Strategic alignment with market-oriented goals is understood

## Constraints
Do NOT apply this evaluation if:
- The request is solely for pilot comfort
- The request is solely for mechanic engagement
- The organization maintains a production-oriented mentality (not market-oriented)

## Evaluation Procedure

### Step 1: Evaluate Purchase Motivation
Determine the primary driver for the aircraft acquisition request. Identify the stated reasons and underlying motivations.

### Step 2: Apply Negative Constraints (The "Never" Rules)
Reject the purchase if:
- The sole purpose is "to give our pilots new cockpits to sit in"
- The sole purpose is "to give our mechanics something new to fiddle with"

### Step 3: Apply Positive Value Condition
Proceed to further evaluation ONLY if the acquisition:
- Enhances value to business travelers

### Step 4: Apply Competitiveness Condition
Verify that the purchase:
- Makes the company more competitive in the market

### Step 5: Strategic Alignment Check
Ensure the decision:
- Supports a shift to a "market-oriented company focused on competitiveness, not technology"
- Considers retaining old planes if they "fit the type of service we wanted to sell, better than any new aircraft would"

### Step 6: Final Decision
Authorize the purchase only if:
- Step 3 (Positive Value Condition) is met
- Step 4 (Competitiveness Condition) is met
- Constraints in Step 2 are not violated

## Output
The evaluation results in one of two outcomes:
- **Purchase Authorized**: Business value and competitiveness are enhanced
- **Request Rejected**: Business value or competitiveness is not enhanced, or negative constraints are violated
