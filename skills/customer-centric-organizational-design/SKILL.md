# Customer-Centric Organizational Design

## When to Use
- Organization faces a changing marketplace or economic losses
- Goal is to achieve corporate excellence
- Organization seeks decentralization
- Want to push decision making to the front line
- Traditional pyramid of authority needs to be inverted
- Top-down only management style is limiting effectiveness

## Core Concepts

### Moment of Truth
The specific instance of interaction between the customer and the company where value is determined. Success is defined by what happens at these critical interactions.

### Inverted Pyramid
Turn the traditional pyramid of authority upside down to shift focus from hierarchy to customer support. Managers must learn to "serve as well as lead."

### Three-Level Horizontal Model

**Level 1 (Top Management): Strategy**
- Responsible for guiding the company into the future
- Anticipating threats and scanning for new opportunities
- Establishing goals and developing strategies
- **Constraint**: Do not make decisions regarding specific actions

**Level 2 (Middle Management): Resources**
- Responsible for planning and allocating resources
- Investing money, recruiting people
- Enabling the operative level
- **Constraint**: Do not make decisions on specific actions; focus on creating prerequisites for others

**Level 3 (Front Line/Operations): Action**
- Responsible for making all specific decisions necessary to run the company
- Decisions made in accordance with top management's goals and strategies
- Maximum influence on product shaping
- Greatest amount of responsibility and authority

## Execution Steps

### 1. Invert the Organizational Pyramid
- Execute structural change by turning the traditional pyramid upside down
- Shift focus from hierarchy to customer support

### 2. Redefine Management Roles
- Managers adopt dual role: serve as well as lead
- Support lower levels of the organization rather than just commanding them

### 3. Prioritize Customer Needs
- Restructure so customer needs take priority over bureaucratic processes
- Focus on what happens at the moment of truth

### 4. Empower Frontline Employees
- Focus motivation and communication efforts on frontline employees
- They deal most closely with customers and require management support

### 5. Implement Three-Level Structure
- Define clear responsibilities for each level
- Ensure decision authority aligns with proximity to customer
- Only the customer pays costs and provides profits
- Front line employees know the customer best

### 6. Share the Vision
- Leaders must share the "guiding vision" (the cathedral)
- Employees need to understand the whole context
- Without this vision, employees cannot make independent decisions
- Delegating without giving prerequisites (vision/strategy) leads nowhere

## Expected Results
- A customer-oriented organization where managers serve frontline staff
- Positive customer interactions at moments of truth
- Economic turnaround from losses to profits
- Frontline employees with maximum influence and authority
- Decisions made by those closest to the customer

## Key Variables
- `organizational_level`: 1 (Strategy), 2 (Resources), or 3 (Operations)
- `decision_type`: Strategic, Resource-based, or Specific Action
- `Pyramid of Authority`: The traditional hierarchy which must be inverted
- `Moment of Truth`: The interaction point between company and customer
- `Frontline Employees`: Staff members who deal most closely with customers

## Prerequisites
- Clear communication of company goals to all employees
- Willingness to divest central control
- Leaders must pass responsibility WITH authority

## Constraints
- Fails if employees are not privy to goals or strategies
- Fails if leaders pass responsibility without authority
