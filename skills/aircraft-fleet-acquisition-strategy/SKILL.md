description: Evaluates whether to acquire new generation aircraft or retain existing fleet based on economic lifetime analysis and business traveler demand. Use when evaluating aircraft purchases, reviewing fleet replacement strategies, or making acquisition decisions for commercial airlines where business traveler demand is a primary revenue driver.

# Aircraft Fleet Acquisition Strategy

## When to Use This Skill
Apply this skill when:
- Evaluating the purchase of new aircraft
- Reviewing fleet replacement strategy
- Comparing new generation aircraft options against existing fleet
- Making acquisition decisions for commercial airlines

## Prerequisites
Before applying this skill, ensure you have:
- Market demand analysis data
- Operational cost data for existing fleet
- Specifications for new generation aircraft options

## Decision Workflow

### Step 1: Adopt Customer-Oriented Perspective
Start strategy formulation with the market instead of the product. Tailor means of production to deliver the best possible products to the customer.

### Step 2: Compare New vs Existing Fleet
When new generation planes are available, do not default to purchasing them. Compare new options against the current fleet.

### Step 3: Evaluate Decision Criteria
Determine if new planes are:
- Better suited for business traveler demands
- More profitable than the planes already in operation

### Step 4: Analyze Aircraft Lifetimes
Assess the relationship between economic and technical lifetimes:

**Economic Lifetime**: The period during which an aircraft remains profitable to operate compared to replacement options.

**Technical Lifetime**: The physical operational lifespan of the aircraft before it wears out.

Compare these two durations:
- If Economic Lifetime > Technical Lifetime: There are seldom any economic reasons to replace planes
- If Economic Lifetime < Technical Lifetime: Replacement may be economically justified

### Step 5: Determine Action

**Retain Existing Fleet** when:
- Existing fleet meets business traveler demand criteria
- Existing fleet remains profitable compared to new options
- Economic lifetime exceeds technical lifetime

**Action**: Invest in cabin refinements and passenger experience improvements rather than replacing airframes.

**Acquire New Fleet** when:
- New aircraft better serve business traveler demands
- New aircraft offer superior profitability
- Economic lifetime analysis supports replacement

## Key Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Economic Lifetime | Duration | Period during which aircraft remains profitable to operate compared to replacements |
| Technical Lifetime | Duration | Physical operational lifespan before aircraft wears out |
| Business Traveler Demand | Market Metric | Specific requirements and preferences of business passengers |

## Output
A decision to either:
1. Retain existing fleet and invest in cabin refinements, or
2. Acquire new generation aircraft based on profitability and suitability analysis
