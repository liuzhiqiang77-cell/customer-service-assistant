# Historical Context: Aircraft Fleet Acquisition

## Economic vs Technical Lifetime Evolution

### Pre-1970s Context
- Economic lifetime was shorter than technical lifetime
- It was profitable to replace planes long before they wore out
- Fleet turnover was driven by economic obsolescence rather than physical wear

### 1970s-1980s Context
- Economic lifetime became longer than technical lifetime
- Aircraft remained economically viable beyond their physical lifespan
- This shift changed acquisition strategies, favoring fleet retention

## Strategic Principle

**Customer-Oriented Perspective**: The core principle driving this analysis is starting with market needs rather than product features. This approach:
- Prioritizes customer experience over equipment upgrades
- Focuses on delivering value where passengers interact with the service (cabin features)
- Avoids unnecessary capital expenditure on airframe replacement when customer needs can be met through refinement

## Applicability

This logic applies specifically to contexts where:
- Business traveler demand is a primary revenue driver
- Commercial airlines are evaluating fleet composition
- Fleet management teams are making long-term asset decisions

## Example Scenario

Airlines operating DC-9s in the 1970s faced the decision of upgrading to new generation aircraft like the Boeing 747 or Airbus offerings. Using this framework:

1. Analyze business traveler demand on current routes
2. Compare DC-9 operating costs and profitability against new options
3. Assess whether DC-9s remain economically viable despite technical age
4. If profitable, invest in DC-9 cabin improvements rather than fleet replacement

This approach allowed airlines to maximize return on existing assets while maintaining customer satisfaction.
