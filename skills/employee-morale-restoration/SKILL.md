# Employee Morale Restoration

## When to Use
- Employee unrest or demands are present
- Morale is low
- List of specific complaints is available
- Management needs to restore mutual respect and willingness to contribute

## Constraints
- Does not apply if systemic failure exceeds 5%
- Requires management willingness to cede reporting control
- Assumes the majority of operations are functioning correctly

## Core Principle: The 95/5 Perspective
If only specific problems are listed, then 95% of everything is fine. Frame the remaining 5% as the actionable focus area. This perspective:
- Acknowledges that most things are working
- Focuses energy on solvable problems
- Prevents overwhelming negativity
- Restores confidence through targeted action

## Execution Steps

### 1. Conduct Staff Meeting
- Address employee demands directly
- Create open forum for discussion
- Facilitate honest expression of concerns

### 2. Create Problem List
- Facilitate creation of a list of specific problems/complaints
- Ensure issues are concrete and actionable
- Capture all concerns without judgment

### 3. Apply the 95/5 Perspective
- Explicitly state that if only specific problems are listed, then 95% of everything is fine
- Frame the remaining 5% as the actionable focus area
- Acknowledge the validity of concerns while maintaining perspective

### 4. Commit to Fixing the 5%
- Promise fixes within a given deadline
- Assign people in charge of solving each problem
- **Critical**: Mandate that progress reports go to the employees, not to top management
- This demonstrates trust and accountability

### 5. Voice Company Expectations
- Provide clear expectations: more service at less cost
- Cut expenses that do not result in more revenue
- Balance addressing concerns with maintaining standards

### 6. Reaffirm Primary Commitment
- Reiterate organizational identity (e.g., "the businessman's airline")
- Remind employees of responsibility to serve paying customers
- Connect individual roles to organizational mission

## Expected Results
- Restored mutual respect between management and employees
- Increased employee morale and willingness to contribute
- Resolution of specific complaints within deadline
- Re-established balance of expectations and demands
- Employees feel heard and valued

## Key Variables
- `complaint_list`: Collection of specific employee grievances
- `fix_deadline`: Specific time commitment for resolving the 5% issues

## Psychological Impact
Restores mutual respect through challenge and fulfillment. By addressing specific concerns while maintaining standards, management demonstrates both care and strength.
