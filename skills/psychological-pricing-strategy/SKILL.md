name: psychological-pricing-strategy
description: Implements psychological pricing strategies using concrete, round-number price points to dramatically increase demand and market share. Use when traditional demand forecasting predicts low growth, you need to significantly increase market share and passenger volume, you have sufficient off-peak capacity, and your target market is price-sensitive.

# Psychological Pricing Strategy

## When to Use
Apply this strategy when:
- Traditional demand forecasting predicts low growth
- You need to significantly increase market share and customer volume
- You have sufficient off-peak capacity to fill
- Your target market demonstrates price sensitivity
- Mathematical models underestimate potential demand

## Prerequisites
- Existing high fare structure to discount from
- Market segment with identified price sensitivity
- Capacity for standby passengers or flexible inventory management
- Sufficient off-peak capacity to accommodate increased volume

## Procedure

### 1. Analyze Traditional Models
Review mathematical calculations and demand forecasts. Recognize that traditional models often underestimate psychological impact. Document the projected volume from standard financial models for comparison.

### 2. Select a Concrete Price Point
Choose a simple, round-number price that is:
- Easy to understand and communicate
- Memorable for customers
- Concrete (e.g., $20, 100 Swedish kronor) rather than percentage-based (e.g., "50% off")

### 3. Ensure Deep Discount
Verify the price represents a substantial reduction:
- Target 60-80% discount from standard fares
- Ensure the discount is significant enough to create psychological impact
- Confirm the price point is low enough to stimulate demand

### 4. Brand the Offer
Create a memorable name based on the price point:
- Use the concrete price in the name (e.g., "Hundred Note")
- Feature prominently in nationwide advertising
- Ensure the branding emphasizes simplicity and value

### 5. Implement Standby Basis
Structure the offer to manage inventory risk:
- Offer tickets on a standby basis
- Use off-peak capacity to minimize disruption to full-fare passengers
- Maintain flexibility to adjust based on demand

### 6. Execute and Monitor
Launch the promotional fare and monitor results:
- Track actual volume vs. mathematical projections
- Expect volume to vastly exceed traditional forecasts
- Measure market share expansion

## Key Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Concrete Price Point | Currency | The specific, low price set for the promotion (e.g., $20) |
| Discount Percentage | Percentage | The reduction from standard fare (e.g., 60-80%) |
| Projected Volume (Math) | Integer | Volume predicted by traditional financial models |
| Actual Volume (Psych) | Integer | Volume achieved through psychological appeal |

## Expected Outcomes
- Dramatic increase in customer volume (often 20-25x mathematical projections)
- Significant market share expansion
- Increased brand awareness
- Efficient utilization of off-peak capacity

## Constraints
- Requires sufficient off-peak capacity
- Price must be low enough to create psychological impact
- Must be structured to manage inventory risk (e.g., standby basis)
- Not suitable for capacity-constrained scenarios
