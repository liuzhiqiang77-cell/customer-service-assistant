name: dual-track-crisis-turnaround
description: Apply a two-pronged strategy for businesses facing declining market demand due to external crises (e.g., oil price shocks, economic downturns). Use when market demand is falling/sagging AND the company has unprofitable customer segments. The strategy simultaneously squeezes costs to survive at lower volumes while restructuring for flexibility to capture recovery.

# Dual-Track Crisis Turnaround Strategy

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this strategy when:
- External factors are causing market demand to drop or prices to escalate
- Your business has high fixed costs
- You have identified unprofitable customer segments
- You need to survive a downturn while positioning for recovery

**Do NOT use** if you can simply cut back on service—this approach is specifically for situations where service cuts would worsen revenue problems.

## Prerequisites

- External crisis impacting demand (e.g., oil price shock, economic recession)
- High fixed cost structure
- Ability to restructure the organization
- Clear visibility into customer profitability by segment

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Analyze the Market Situation

Identify external factors causing the crisis:
- Determine what is driving price escalation or demand drop
- Quantify current customer volume
- Identify unprofitable customer segments (e.g., special pricing, low-margin accounts)

### Step 2: Reject Standard Cost-Cutting Approaches

**Do NOT simply cut back on service in a sagging market.**

Reasoning: Cutting service brings in less revenue, creating a more serious problem than the cost saving solves. Service reductions compound the demand decline.

### Step 3: Implement the 'Squeeze Costs' Track

Calculate and prepare for the lowest sustainable customer volume:
- Determine your break-even volume target (e.g., plan for a drop from 210,000 to 170,000 customers)
- Drive costs down aggressively to ensure profitability at this reduced volume
- Eliminate unprofitable components:
  - Special priced trips or services
  - Low-margin customer segments
  - Non-essential overhead

### Step 4: Implement the 'Flexibility' Track (Crucial)

Restructure the organization simultaneously to be more flexible:
- Design processes that can scale up quickly
- Maintain capacity to handle increased demand if market bounces back
- Avoid permanent reductions that would block recovery growth
- Ensure staffing and systems can expand rapidly

### Step 5: Monitor and Execute

Track these key variables:
- Current customer volume vs. break-even target
- Cost structure alignment with reduced volume
- Organizational flexibility metrics
- Market recovery signals

## Expected Outcomes

- **During crisis:** Profitability is maintained even at reduced volumes
- **Upon recovery:** Flexible structure absorbs new demand easily
- **Final result:** Survival during crisis and record profits upon recovery

## Key Variables

| Variable | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Current_Volume | Integer | Current number of customers |
| Break_Even_Volume | Integer | Target low volume to remain profitable |
| Org_Flexibility | Boolean | Ability to scale up operations quickly |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Cutting service levels** - this accelerates revenue decline
2. **Focusing only on cost cuts** - without flexibility, you miss recovery
3. **Delaying restructuring** - flexibility must be built during the downturn
4. **Keeping unprofitable segments** - they drain resources needed for recovery
