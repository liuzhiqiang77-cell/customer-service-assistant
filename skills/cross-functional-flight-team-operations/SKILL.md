# Cross-Functional Flight Team Operations

## When to Use
Deploy this workflow when preparing for a specific flight departure that requires a dedicated cross-functional team to manage the passenger experience from check-in to boarding.

## Prerequisites
- Reciprocal training program completed (passenger-service and sales staff have trained each other)
- Flattened organizational structure in place
- Team members capable of handling diverse tasks (tickets, cargo, phones, load checks)

## Team Composition
1. Assign 15 members total to the specific flight (e.g., Stockholm-New York) from start to finish
2. Designate 2 members as Coaches:
   - 1 Indoor Coach
   - 1 Outdoor Coach (positioned by the plane)

## Execution Workflow

### Phase 1: Pre-Flight Briefing
- Indoor Coach participates in flight crew briefing
- Consult on pre-flight information:
  - Appropriate time to begin boarding
  - Presence of infants or disabled people on passenger list
  - Confirmation of special meal orders

### Phase 2: Morning Check-In
- Indoor team assembles at check-in counters
- Perform tasks:
  - Solve ticketing problems
  - Assign seats
  - Handle fragile baggage
  - Check in passengers
- Proactive Service Examples:
  - Confirm suspended cradle is on board for mothers with babies
  - Keep seat beside mother free if possible

### Phase 3: Transition to Gate
- As passengers check in, team gradually moves to departure gate
- Greet passengers in recognition
- Answer specific questions:
  - Transfers
  - Stopovers
  - Flight time
  - Captain announcements

## Service Delivery Rules

### Communication Style
- Do not use verbatim scripts (e.g., old PA announcements)
- Improvise in a conversational manner suitable to:
  - Employees
  - Passengers
  - Current situation

### Problem Resolution
- Solve problems on the spot immediately as they arise
- No frontline employee waits for supervisor permission
- Empower team members to make decisions independently

## Expected Outcome
Seamless passenger experience from check-in to boarding with immediate problem resolution.
