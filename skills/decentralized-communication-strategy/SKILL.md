# Decentralized Communication Strategy

## When to Use
- Organization moves from hierarchical to decentralized structure
- Need to align employees with vision without issuing orders
- Communicating strategy to thousands of decentralized decision-makers
- Traditional command-and-control management no longer applicable
- Employees must apply strategy to specific situations without constant supervision

## Core Principle: Receiver-Centric Communication

### Old Way (Hierarchical)
- Boss words message correctly
- Employees struggle to understand orders
- Communication flows one-way down

### New Way (Decentralized)
- Leader considers words the *receiver* can best absorb
- Leader adopts receiver's language
- Communication enables understanding and action

## Communication Process

### 1. Dedicate Time to Communication
- Leaders should spend more time communicating than anything else
- Example: Jan Carlzon spent half his working hours "out in the field"
- Communication is primary leadership activity in flat organizations

### 2. Shift Communication Approach
- Cannot *order* employees in flat structure
- Must *convince* them to take responsibility
- Persuasion replaces command
- Alignment replaces compliance

### 3. Develop Simple Communication Tools
Create materials that present:
- Overall vision
- Strategy
- Specific expectations

**Tool Design Requirements**:
- Few words in big type
- Visual aids (e.g., cartoonlike drawings)
- Accessible format (e.g., booklets)
- Digestible content

### 4. Apply Language Constraints
- Use plainer, more straightforward language
- Accept there is no such thing as an "oversimplified" phrase
- Prioritize being "too clear" or "too simple" over risking misunderstanding
- Messages should be simple, direct "battle cries"

**Examples of Clear Targets**:
- JFK's moon declaration
- "We are going to be world champions in three years"

### 5. Accept Criticism
- Intellectuals or highly educated employees may view simple tools as "simplistic"
- May be seen as "beneath them"
- Prioritize internal effectiveness over complexity
- Tool must help employees understand and carry out vision

### 6. Establish Clear Targets
- Messages serve as "battle cries"
- Direct and simple
- Enable employees to apply general strategy to specific situations

## Key Variables
- **communication_tool**: Medium used to convey vision (booklet, video, etc.)
- **employee_education_level**: Academic/professional background of workforce
- **message_complexity**: Complexity of language used

## Expected Outcomes
- Employees truly understand and absorb strategy
- Employees apply general strategy to specific situations
- Employees voluntarily take responsibility for vision
- Alignment achieved without command-and-control
