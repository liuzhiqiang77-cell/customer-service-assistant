- Pitched the new strategy and security of public utility status
- Leveraged the turnaround narrative

**Outcome:**
- Secured loan repatriation to Swedish market despite poor metrics
- Financial barrier overcome through persistence and strategic articulation

## Case 2: Regulatory/Bureaucratic Wall - EuroClass Check-in

**Situation:**
- Internal belief that egalitarian Scandinavian authorities would reject separate check-in
- Assumption based on "social class" concerns in Scandinavian culture
- Team assumed approval was impossible

**Action Taken:**
- Submitted the request anyway
- Explained the **overall business strategy** and turnaround context
- Framed it as strategic necessity rather than social differentiation

**Outcome:**
- Scandinavian boards of civil aviation understood strategic importance
- Approved immediately
- Assumed barrier proved to be a cardboard facade

## Case 3: Performance/Competition Wall - Vingresor Profits

**Situation:**
- Competitor (Thomson) earns $20/head
- Vingresor earns <$2/head
- Target set at $20/head based on competitor benchmark

**Action Taken:**
- Launched aggressive promotions
- Implemented gimmicks, sales contests, prizes (cars, cows)
- Pushed for dramatic performance improvement

**Outcome:**
- Profits increased to $8/head
- Plateaued below $20 target
