description: Overcome perceived impossible obstacles by challenging assumptions and persisting until receiving explicit rejection. Use when facing psychological barriers, assumed regulatory blocks, financial constraints, or competitive gaps where objections are based on assumptions rather than explicit denials.

# Running Through Walls Principle

Break through perceived barriers by treating assumptions as cardboard facades rather than stone walls. Persist until an authority explicitly says "no."

## When to Apply

Use this principle when:
- Internal or external obstacles suggest a goal is impossible
- Objections are based on assumptions rather than explicit rejection
- Team members use assumptions to kill ideas early ("authorities will never let us", "that will never work")
- Management calculates odds of permission without actually asking
- Competitors achieve results that seem out of reach

## Core Mindset

- Assume barriers (walls) may be cardboard facades rather than stone
- Do not stop trying until an authority figure explicitly says "No"
- Challenge the assumption of impossibility through action, not debate

## Execution Steps

### 1. Identify Psychological Barriers

Recognize when the team kills ideas based on:
- Assumed authority rejection
- Assumed regulatory impossibility
- Assumed competitive unreachability

### 2. Adopt Persistence Mindset

Shift from "assuming no" to "testing until explicit no."

### 3. Execute Based on Barrier Type

#### Financial/Structural Barriers
- Contact every institution in the market
- Leverage your overall strategy and unique positioning
- Present the security and viability of your approach

#### Regulatory/Bureaucratic Barriers
- Submit the request despite assumptions
- Explain the **overall business strategy** and context
- Help authorities understand the strategic importance

#### Performance/Competitive Barriers
- Set aggressive targets based on competitor benchmarks
- Launch aggressive promotional activities
- Accept substantial improvements even if targets aren't fully met

## Constraints

Does not apply to:
- Illegal activities
- Safety violations
- Situations where explicit rejection has already occurred
