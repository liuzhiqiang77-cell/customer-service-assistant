# Organizational Punctuality Strategy

## When to Use
- Implementing punctuality campaign
- Need to revitalize reputation for timeliness
- Budget allocated for punctuality initiatives
- Current punctuality targets allow too much flexibility
- Flight/operation consolidation undermining customer satisfaction

## Strategic Initiatives

### 1. Eliminate Consolidation
**Stop**:
- Cancelling half-full flights to save fuel
- Prioritizing cost savings over customer experience

**Start**:
- Allocate budget to ensure all scheduled flights run
- Run flights even if less than half full
- Example: Allocate $1.8 million to maintain full schedule

**Rationale**:
- Consolidation frustrated passengers
- Undermined punctuality despite previous savings (e.g., $2.6 million saved)
- Customer satisfaction worth more than short-term savings

### 2. Set 100% Punctuality Target
**Change Target**:
- From: 80% on-time departure
- To: 100% on-time departure

**Rationale**:
- 80% target provided "escape valve" (allowing 20% to be late)
- Reduced individual accountability
- 100% makes punctuality a group concern
- Eliminates acceptable failure rate

### 3. Introduce Service Manager Role
**Responsibilities**:
- Resolve problems on the ground (not passed to crew)
- Facilitate boarding process

**Special Power**:
- If large crowd present, override manual boarding instructions
- Start boarding earlier than scheduled
- Authority to prioritize customer experience over process

### 4. Optimize Maintenance Efficiency
**Actions**:
- Tighten maintenance service time back to optimal range
- Example: DC-9 maintenance at 15-19 hours (previously increased)
- Ensure increased speed does not compromise safety

**Expected Result**:
- Stimulates general increase in precision
- Enhances safety attention
- Improves operational efficiency

### 5. Executive Monitoring
**Implementation**:
- President monitors progress via computer terminal
- Update terminal every 5 minutes
- Real-time visibility into performance

**Actions**:
- Call with appreciation for good work
  - Example: Oslo on time in poor weather
- Inquire about delays
- Demonstrate top management's valuation of punctuality

**Purpose**:
- Show punctuality is executive priority
- Create accountability throughout organization
- Reinforce importance of timeliness

## Key Variables
- **target_percentage**: On-time departure goal (100%)
- **flight_load_factor**: How full the flight is
- **maintenance_duration**: Time for maintenance checks (15-19 hours)
- **update_frequency**: Terminal update interval (5 minutes)

## Constraints
- Must maintain safety guidelines
- Cannot exceed maintenance technical limits
- Budget required for full schedule operation

## Expected Outcomes
- Revitalized reputation for punctuality
- Increased customer load/satisfaction
- Flattened organizational pyramid
- Increased motivation throughout organization
- Enhanced operational precision
