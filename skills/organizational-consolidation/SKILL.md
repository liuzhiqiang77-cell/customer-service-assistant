name: organizational-consolidation
description: Consolidate multiple operational locations into a single primary location to reduce costs and increase efficiency while maintaining service quality. Use when organizational structure is outmoded, workloads are uneven across locations, or redundant locations exist.

# Organizational Consolidation Strategy

## When to Use This Skill

Apply consolidation when:
- Organizational structure has become outmoded
- Workloads are unevenly distributed across locations
- Redundant or low-utility locations exist
- Cost reduction is needed without sacrificing service quality
- Staff efficiency needs improvement
- Organizational flexibility needs enhancement

## Prerequisites

- Identification of outmoded organizational structure
- Evidence of uneven workloads across locations
- Analysis of operational capacity requirements
- Understanding of peak-time service demands

## Consolidation Process

### 1. Establish Strategic Goals

Define three major objectives for restructuring:
- **Goal 1**: Cut costs without sacrificing service quality
- **Goal 2**: Increase staff efficiency
- **Goal 3**: Increase organizational structure flexibility

### 2. Diagnose Location Inefficiencies

Analyze each operational site:

**For Satellite Locations (e.g., Downtown Office):**
- Assess purpose: Determine if location serves distinct purpose beyond being a "meeting place"
- Evaluate capacity: Verify if departments can handle operational demands
- Identify redundancy: Check if functions duplicate primary location capabilities

**For Primary Locations (e.g., Airport):**
- Assess workload distribution: Check if employee workload is uneven
- Identify idle time: Look for personnel with little to do during operational gaps
- Evaluate capacity utilization: Measure efficient use of time and resources

### 3. Execute Consolidation

If inefficiencies are identified:
- Consolidate all employees and services at the primary operational location
- Eliminate low-utility satellite locations
- Redistribute workforce to address idle time and workload imbalances
- Maintain service quality thresholds throughout transition

## Expected Outcome

A consolidated organizational structure operating from a single location, with reduced costs, increased efficiency, and maintained service quality.

## Constraints

- Must not sacrifice quality of service
- Must maintain operational capacity for peak times
- Must ensure service quality threshold is met
- Requires careful workload redistribution planning
