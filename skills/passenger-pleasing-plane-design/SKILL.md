# Passenger Pleasing Plane (3-P) Design Strategy

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- An airline seeks substantial competitive advantage
- Has time to design new aircraft (not immediate replacement needed)
- Existing fleet will remain operational for design period
- Management committed to passenger comfort over pure production efficiency

## Prerequisites
- Existing fleet (e.g., DC-9s) must remain operational for a few years
- Management commitment to passenger comfort
- Time for design and development process

## Execution Steps

### 1. Assess Strategic Window
Confirm:
- Current aircraft will remain operational for a few years
- Sufficient time exists to design for passenger comfort
- Not forced into immediate replacement

### 2. Define Core Objective
Establish the goal to build a "Passenger Pleasing Plane" (3-P) that:
- Prioritizes customer experience over production technology metrics
- Creates competitive advantage through differentiation
- Focuses on cabin innovations

### 3. Implement Specific Cabin Innovations

The aircraft must feature real innovations in the passenger cabin:

**Seating:**
- Ensure "no middle seats"
- Avoid 3-seat-per-side configurations (e.g., Boeing 737s)
- Prioritize passenger comfort over density

**Storage:**
- Provide "more space to store carry-on luggage"
- Address modern passenger needs

**Mobility:**
- Install "wider twin aisles and doors"
- Facilitate "easier mobility onboard and in disembarking"
- Reduce boarding/deplaning time

**Environment:**
- Achieve "reduced cabin noise"
- Improve overall comfort experience

### 4. Avoid Production-Only Focus

**Do NOT select aircraft solely because:**
- They are the "best alternative" in production technology
- They offer theoretical efficiency gains
- They are readily available

**DO prioritize:**
- Passenger comfort features
- Competitive differentiation
- Customer experience metrics

## Key Variables
- **current_fleet_status**: Remaining operational life of existing planes
- **cabin_configuration**: Layout of seats and aisles (must exclude middle seats)
- **comfort_features**: Specific amenities like carry-on space, aisle width, noise levels

## Constraints
- Do not equate buying new planes with doing good business based on production technology
- Must avoid configurations that increase "middle seats"
- Requires design time (not for immediate fleet replacement)

## Output
A set of aircraft requirements focused on passenger comfort (3-P) to be presented to manufacturers for development.
