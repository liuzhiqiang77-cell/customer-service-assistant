# Strategic Comparison: Production vs. Customer Focus in Aircraft Design

## Lufthansa: Production Focus

**Approach:**
- Selected Boeing 737 based on production technology
- Prioritized efficiency and availability
- Accepted standard configuration with middle seats

**Result:**
- Standard aircraft, no differentiation
- Competitive advantage based on other factors

## SAS: Customer Focus (3-P Strategy)

**Approach:**
- Designed "Passenger Pleasing Plane" from customer needs
- Prioritized comfort over production metrics
- Required design time, not immediate purchase

**Key Innovations:**
- No middle seats
- More carry-on storage space
- Wider twin aisles and doors
- Reduced cabin noise

**Result:**
- First cabin innovations since DC-3 (50 years prior)
- Substantial competitive advantage
- Differentiated customer experience

## Strategic Insight

**Production-Oriented Thinking:**
- "What aircraft is available and efficient?"
- Leads to commoditization
- No competitive differentiation

**Customer-Driven Thinking:**
- "What aircraft experience do customers want?"
- Creates differentiation
- Builds competitive advantage

**Key Quote:**
"Do not equate buying new planes with doing good business" - must focus on customer value, not just equipment acquisition.
