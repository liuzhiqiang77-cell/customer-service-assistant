# EuroClass Business Differentiation

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Targeting business travelers on European flight routes
- Current product mix is inefficient or not capturing full-fare revenue
- Need to prevent discount fares from cannibalizing full-fare revenue
- Existing First Class is underutilized and viewed as cost-ineffective

## Prerequisites

- European flight routes in operation
- Existing full-fare and discount fare structures in place
- Ability to make operational changes to aircraft and terminals

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Eliminate First Class
Remove First Class from European flights. First Class is often viewed as an expensive dining room for executives with low utilization.

### 2. Create EuroClass Pricing
Establish EuroClass at full-fare coach prices. This positions the product as premium but accessible to business travelers.

### 3. Manage Discount Fares
Retain discount fares but do not promote them heavily. Focus marketing and service efforts on business travelers and EuroClass.

### 4. Implement Visible Differentiation

**Aircraft Modifications:**
- Install movable partitions on aircraft to physically separate EuroClass from tourist class

**Terminal Enhancements:**
- Provide comfortable lounges with telephone and telex services
- Establish separate check-in counters for EuroClass passengers

### 5. Implement Service Level Differentiation

**Check-in Service:**
- Target: Less than 6 minutes for EuroClass (vs. 10 minutes for tourist class)

**Boarding/Disembarking:**
- Board last (after tourist class)
- Disembark first (before tourist class)

**Catering:**
- Receive meals first
- Complimentary drinks
- Newspapers and magazines provided

**Seating:**
- More comfortable seats compared to tourist class

## Key Metrics

- **EuroClass check-in time target:** < 6 minutes
- **Tourist class check-in time target:** 10 minutes
- **Revenue metric:** Full-fare coach price capture from business travelers

## Expected Outcome

A distinct Business Class product (EuroClass) that:
- Persuades business travelers to pay full-fare coach prices
- Reduces reliance on discount fares
- Increases overall revenue efficiency
- Provides clear value differentiation for business travelers

## Constraints

- Requires operational changes to aircraft and terminals
- Must not cannibalize existing full-fare revenue
- Focus on business travelers, not leisure travelers
