# Strategic Integrity Defense

## When to Use
Apply this skill when:
- Competitors or regulators demand abandonment of a core strategy element
- Abandoning the requested element would cause your strategy to collapse
- You have a clearly enunciated strategy with non-negotiable principles
- You have or can secure government/political backing for your position

## Core Variables
- **Core_Strategy_Principle**: The non-negotiable rule (e.g., "No Surcharge")
- **Competitor_Rigid_Asset**: Fixed infrastructure limiting the opponent (e.g., permanent partitions)

## Execution Steps

### 1. Define Non-Negotiable Strategy Elements
Establish core principles that cannot be compromised. For example, SAS established that "EuroClass will cost no more than the full-fare coach ticket" as a non-negotiable principle, contrasting with competitors like Air France whose Classe Affaires required a surcharge.

### 2. Prepare for Regulatory Conflict
Recognize that industry regulations often give competitors "veto power" through bilateral agreements. Anticipate specific threats such as:
- Termination of operational agreements
- Market access restrictions
- Regulatory barriers

Acknowledge competitor leverage, especially with state-owned entities or those with strong political connections.

### 3. Leverage Government Support
Ensure your strategy is clearly enunciated to your own government authorities. When strategy is sound, government will provide "unquestioning support" and may issue parallel threats to the aggressor. Be prepared for diplomatic intervention at high levels (e.g., foreign minister meetings).

### 4. Exploit Competitor Rigidity
Maintain operational flexibility while identifying competitor inflexibility:
- Use flexible infrastructure (e.g., movable partitions to adjust service class size)
- Identify fixed competitor assets that restrict their capacity and profitability
- Leverage this asymmetry during conflict

### 5. Execute the Conflict
Stand firm on your non-negotiable principles:
- Refuse to acquiesce to competitor or regulatory demands
- Retaliate competitively if necessary (e.g., fare matching)
- Escalate to appropriate resolution channels when needed

### 6. Secure Resolution
Work toward outcomes that:
- Preserve your right to maintain the core strategy
- Force competitors to adapt to the new competitive reality
- Maintain your strategic positioning in the market

## Constraints
- Requires political/government backing to succeed against larger state-owned entities
- High conflict intensity with risk of regulatory war
- Success depends on having a clearly enunciated and defensible strategy

## Expected Outcome
Preservation of business strategy and market positioning despite regulatory threats, forcing competitors to adapt or fail under the new competitive dynamics.
