# Symbolic Leadership and Behavior Modeling

Use this skill when you are in a leadership position and your actions are being observed by employees. The goal is to ensure your behavior aligns with and reinforces "Customer First" and "Results First" values through symbolic gestures.

## Core Principles

- **Customer always comes first**: Actions must visibly demonstrate customer priority
- **Results count more than prestige**: Eliminate symbols that prioritize status over function
- **Actions have symbolic value**: Employees adopt and mirror leadership behavior
- **Cultural hierarchy**: Model Customer > Employee > Management ranking through behavior

## When to Apply

- You occupy a leadership or executive position
- Employees can observe your behavior, lifestyle, and workplace arrangements
- You are making decisions about resource allocation or workplace facilities
- You are interacting with customers or traveling on behalf of the organization
- There is a discrepancy between stated values and visible leadership practices

## Execution Steps

### 1. Audit Symbolic Discrepancies

Assess your current behavior and arrangements for symbolic messaging:

- Review your office space, dining arrangements, and travel accommodations
- Identify differences between your privileges and staff's reality
- Consider what messages your lifestyle and choices send to employees

### 2. Eliminate Prestige Symbols

Remove or repurpose status-focused amenities:

- **Executive dining rooms**: Convert to general conference rooms or shared spaces
- **Large, bright offices**: Prioritize functional needs over size and prestige
- **Workspace arrangement**: Consider moving your desk into shared spaces to increase visibility
- **Exclusive amenities**: Eliminate any perks not available to all employees

### 3. Model Consistent Behavior

Align your daily actions with expectations set for staff:

- Eat meals in staff cafeterias or canteens rather than separate dining areas
- Avoid excessive business travel if you are restricting travel for staff
- Use the same tools and resources as employees when practical
- Follow the same processes and protocols you expect from the team

### 4. Demonstrate Customer Priority

Make customer priority visible through specific actions:

- **Board aircraft**: Board after all passengers have boarded
- **In-flight service**: Accept magazines, newspapers, or service only after every passenger has been served
- **Customer interactions**: Always give immediate attention to customer needs over executive matters
- **Service delays**: Experience the same constraints as customers when service issues occur

### 5. Interpret and Reinforce Impact

Understand the cultural significance of your actions:

- These gestures show respect for employees' work and reality
- They reinforce the organizational ranking: Customer > Employee > Management
- Consistent symbolic alignment builds trust and authentic culture
- Visible leadership commitment drives employee adoption of desired behaviors

## Risk Indicators

Monitor for **symbolic discrepancy**—the gap between leadership privilege and staff reality. This risk manifests as:

- Perceived hypocrisy between stated values and visible leadership practices
- Resentment from staff about unequal treatment
- Cultural confusion about what behaviors are truly valued
- Undermining of official organizational priorities

## Expected Outcomes

When applied consistently, this skill produces:

- Employees adopt the desired behaviors modeled by leadership
- Customers perceive a genuinely market-oriented culture
- Reduced perception of hierarchy and increased organizational cohesion
- Alignment between stated values and visible leadership actions
