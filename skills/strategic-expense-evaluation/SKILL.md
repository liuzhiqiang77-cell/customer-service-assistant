name: strategic-expense-evaluation
description: A framework for evaluating corporate expenses, operational procedures, and resource allocation against specific strategic goals. Use when a company needs profitability in a stagnant market and costs have already been cut to the bone. This approach avoids generic cost-cutting and instead aligns all resources with serving a specific target customer segment.

# Strategic Expense Evaluation

## When to Use

Apply this skill when:
- Company needs profitability improvements in a stagnant market
- Traditional cost-cutting measures have been exhausted (costs already cut to bone)
- You need to align resources with a specific strategic goal or target customer segment
- You want to avoid the "cheese slicer" approach of equal cuts across all activities

## Prerequisites

Before applying this framework, ensure:
1. Clear strategic goal is defined
2. Target customer segment is identified (e.g., frequent business travelers)

## Evaluation Procedure

### Step 1: Define the Strategic Question

For every resource, expense, and procedure, ask:

> "Do we need this in order to serve [target customer segment]?"

### Step 2: Apply Decision Logic

Evaluate each item based on the answer:

- **If NO**: Phase out the expense or procedure immediately, regardless of internal value or attachment
- **If YES**: Increase investment to develop it further and enhance competitiveness
- **If MISSING**: Add it to the portfolio to better serve the target segment

### Step 3: Execute Decisions

Generate three action lists:
1. Expenses and procedures to eliminate
2. Expenses and areas to increase investment
3. New services or capabilities to implement

## Critical Anti-Patterns

### Avoid the "Cheese Slicer" Method

The "cheese slicer" approach cuts costs equally from all activities. This is dangerous because:
- It eliminates competitive strengths
- It saps staff initiative and morale
- It treats all activities as equally important

### Correct Philosophy

Adopt this mindset:
> "Be one percent better at 100 things instead of being 100 percent better at one thing."

This means making targeted, strategic improvements across many areas that matter to your target customer, rather than perfecting one area while neglecting others.

## Output

The evaluation produces:
- A prioritized list of expenses to eliminate
- A list of areas requiring increased investment
- A list of new services/capabilities to add
