# Customer-Centric Business Definition

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Defining company identity or mission
- Developing new services or products
- Evaluating business scope and market positioning
- Management is relying on internal assumptions without customer validation

## Prerequisites
- Identified customer base
- Existing product or service offering
- Access to actual customers for validation

## Execution Steps

### 1. Acquire Customer Orientation
Shift perspective from internal/production view to customer view.

### 2. Analyze from Customer's Point of View
Ask:
- What problem does the customer actually need solved?
- What service is the customer really buying?
- How does the customer perceive value?

### 3. Redefine the Business
Decide what business you are really in based on customer needs, not what you produce.

**Common Redefinition Examples:**
- **Airlines**: Not "airline business" but "service business to transport people safely and efficiently"
- **Auto Manufacturers**: Not "automobile business" but "ground transport service business" (could sell access via card rather than hardware)
- **Banks**: Not handling coins/notes but "managing information flow about economic transactions"

### 4. Validate with Actual Customers (CRITICAL)

**Do NOT rely on:**
- Assumptions by senior management
- Internal consensus without customer input
- Management removed from frontlines

**DO validate by:**
- Testing concepts with actual customers
- Gathering feedback before investment
- Confirming real needs vs. perceived needs

## Critical Validation Step

### Failure Example: Vingresor Case Study
- **Management Assumption**: Seniors wanted safety, Swedish food, isolation
- **Actual Customer Needs**: Adventure, beaches, excitement
- **Result**: $10,000 wasted on brochures, zero customers

### Success Pattern
- Validate before investing
- Listen to frontline customer feedback
- Challenge internal assumptions

## Key Variables
- **business_identity**: The core function the business provides to the customer (e.g., transport vs. car)

## Constraints
- Fails if management relies solely on internal assumptions
- Requires access to actual customers for validation
- Must overcome production-oriented philosophy
