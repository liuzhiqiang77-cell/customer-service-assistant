# Business Redefinition Examples

## Industry Transformations

### Airlines
**Traditional View**: "We are in the airline business"
**Customer-Centric View**: "We are in the service business to transport people safely and efficiently"
**Implication**: Focus on the transport service, not just flying planes

### Auto Manufacturers
**Traditional View**: "We are in the automobile business"
**Customer-Centric View**: "We are in the ground transport service business"
**Implication**: Could sell access (e.g., a plastic card guaranteeing a car) rather than just hardware

### Banks
**Traditional View**: "We handle coins and notes"
**Customer-Centric View**: "We manage information flow about economic transactions"
**Implication**: Focus on information management, not physical currency

## Validation Case Studies

### Vingresor Failure
**Assumptions Made:**
- Seniors want safety
- Seniors want Swedish food
- Seniors want isolation

**Reality Discovered:**
- Seniors want adventure
- Seniors want beaches
- Seniors want excitement

**Consequences:**
- $10,000 invested in brochures
- Zero customers acquired
- Complete product failure

**Lesson**: Never assume customer needs without validation
