# Advertising Message Clarity

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Developing marketing campaigns, product launches, or brand advertising
- Communicating business strategy to customers through marketing channels
- Creating customer-facing messaging that requires clear understanding
- Optimizing marketing budget by focusing on message effectiveness

## Core Principle

If the strategy is not clear to customers, the strategy is effectively useless. Clarity is the foundation of effective external communication.

## Execution Procedure

### 1. Validate Message Clarity

Before launching any campaign, assess whether the core message is immediately understandable to your target audience. If customers cannot quickly grasp what you offer and why it matters, revise the message.

### 2. Avoid Vague Messaging

Do not use generic proclamations that few remember or understand. Vague slogans waste marketing spend and fail to drive action.

**Examples to avoid:**
- "Give the Swedes the World" (abstract, no concrete meaning)
- "We're the best" (unsubstantiated claim)

### 3. Communicate Specific Value

Use solid, actionable information that customers can use to make decisions. Focus on tangible benefits rather than aspirational statements.

**Effective messaging examples:**
- "No need to stand in line!" (specific pain point solved)
- "New lounges for business travelers!" (clear benefit for specific audience)
- "You don't have to fight for a good seat!" (addresses common frustration)
- "As close as you can get to first class on a coach-class ticket!" (comparable, understandable value)

### 4. Use Concrete Pricing and Terms

Ensure product names, pricing terms, and service descriptions imply value clearly. Avoid internal jargon or confusing acronyms.

**Examples:**
- ✓ "Hundred Note" (immediately understood as a pricing tier)
- ✗ "YSO" (internal term with no customer-facing meaning)

### 5. Optimize Budget for Clarity

Spend existing budget on easily understood messages rather than increasing the total budget for vague ads. Clear messaging yields better ROI than increased spend on unclear communication.

## Expected Outcome

Customers understand the offer and select the service based on clear, specific benefits they can evaluate.

## Constraints

- Do not rely on increasing marketing budget to fix unclear messaging
- Avoid vague proclamations and aspirational statements
- Never assume customers will interpret unclear messaging positively
