# Business Traveler Strategic Prioritization

## When to Use
Apply this skill when:
- Evaluating a new business opportunity, route, or service
- Assessing route proposals (e.g., Stockholm to New York)
- Reviewing business proposals or marketing events
- Deciding whether to accept or reject service offerings
- The target customer segment is the Frequent Business Traveler

## Core Workflow

### 1. Identify Target Customer
Confirm the primary focus is the **Frequent Business Traveler** segment.

### 2. Determine Customer Priority
Acknowledge that for this segment:
- **Convenience** is the highest priority
- Convenience ranks above **price**
- Nonstop routes are preferred over cost savings

### 3. Evaluate Route Proposals

**For Nonstop Routes:**
- Prioritize nonstop routes even if they require smaller aircraft
- Example: Choose DC-10 nonstop over Boeing 747 with stops
- Recognize that nonstop routes may appear unprofitable initially but can become most profitable through business traveler loyalty

**For Multi-Stop Routes:**
- Anticipate customer defection to competitors with better connections
- Example: Routes via Oslo or Copenhagen may lose customers to competitors offering connections via London or Amsterdam

### 4. Apply Strategic Exclusion (Saying "No")

Screen all business offers and proposals:

**Reject opportunities that:**
- Are "good ideas" but do not fit the frequent business traveler strategy
- Target non-core segments (e.g., international tourist industry conventions, children's clubs, vacation discounts)

**Rationale for rejection:**
- Resist making bad business deals
- Avoid dissipating energy on non-core segments
- Maintain focus on the target customer

## Decision Logic

```
IF evaluating a new business opportunity, route, or service:
  IF target customer IS Frequent Business Traveler:
    IF opportunity enhances convenience:
      ACCEPT
    ELSE IF opportunity is non-aligned with business traveler needs:
      REJECT
  ELSE:
    This skill does not apply
```

## Key Variables

- **customer_segment**: The target demographic (e.g., Frequent Business Traveler)
- **route_type**: Nonstop vs. Multi-stop
- **strategic_fit**: Whether the opportunity aligns with business traveler needs

## Expected Outcome

- Acceptance of opportunities that enhance business traveler convenience
- Rejection of non-aligned opportunities
- Strategic focus on routes and services that prioritize convenience over cost
