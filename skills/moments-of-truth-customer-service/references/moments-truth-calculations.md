# Moments of Truth Calculations

## Basic Formula
```
Total Annual Moments = Total Customers × Average Contacts per Customer
```

## Example: SAS Airlines
- Total Customers: 10 million
- Contacts per Customer: ~5 employees
- Total Moments: 50 million times per year
- Duration per Contact: 15 seconds

## Impact Analysis
- Each moment is binary: Success or Failure
- Success = Customer perceives company as best alternative
- Failure = Customer seeks alternatives
- Cumulative moments determine company success or failure

## Key Constraints
- No time to reference rule books
- No opportunity to "ask the boss"
- Must rely on frontline judgment and training
- Information must be available beforehand, not during the moment
