# Cargo Precision and Financial Alignment Strategy

## When to Use
- Organization needs to improve service precision
- Need to enhance profitability
- Employees unable to see financial impact of their decisions
- Performance varies across locations/stations
- Need to enable operational autonomy

## Strategic Process

### 1. Measurement and Comparison
- Measure the right indicators
- Compare performance across different stations
- Example: New York vs. Copenhagen
- Identify specific problem areas through comparison
- Use data-driven approach to pinpoint issues

### 2. Develop Customer Insight
- Gain new understanding of what's important to customers
- Identify primary value drivers
- In this context: **Precision** is the key value driver
- Focus on what customers actually care about

### 3. Financial Integration
**Combine**:
- New strategy
- Operational measurements
- Financial information

**Purpose**:
- Ensure financial consequences of routine decisions are visible to everyone
- Connect daily actions to financial outcomes
- Make cost/revenue implications clear

### 4. Focus on Profitability
**Enable employees to**:
- Identify profitable activities
- Understand financial impact of their actions
- Focus on activities that drive profit
- Make financially informed decisions

**Result**:
- Employees autonomously focus on profitable activities
- Enhanced customer precision
- Improved financial results

### 5. Define Components of Precision (Moments of Truth)
Explicitly define specific activities constituting precision for customers:

**Precision Components**:
1. Answering telephones
2. Booking shipments
3. Receiving shipments
4. Forwarding shipments with documentation
5. Receiving cargo and documentation at destination
6. Reconciling cargo and documentation
7. Preparing for customer pick-up
8. Informing customers when shipments are ready

**Why Define These**:
- Creates clear standards
- Makes expectations explicit
- Enables measurement
- Guides employee behavior

### 6. Establish Operational Autonomy
**Actions**:
- Establish clear standards for doing things "right"
- Define measures for performance
- Set expectations for quality

**Benefits**:
- Employees can self-pace their work
- Know when to work and when to relax
- No need to wait for supervisor instructions
- Eliminates unnecessary rushing
- Enables autonomous decision-making

## Key Variables
- **Precision_Indicators**: Operational metrics compared across stations
- **Financial_Consequences**: Cost/revenue data linked to routine decisions
- **Performance_Standards**: Defined criteria for "right" performance

## Constraints
- Requires management to define specific standards for "right" performance
- Needs operational performance data
- Requires financial data integration
- Must have customer feedback to validate priorities

## Expected Outcomes
- Employees autonomously focus on profitable activities
- Enhanced customer precision
- Improved service quality
- Better financial results
- Increased operational autonomy
- Self-paced work without constant supervision
- Clear connection between daily actions and financial outcomes
