description: Implement and utilize the QualiCargo precision measurement system to monitor cargo terminal performance, identify operational bottlenecks through quantification, and drive data-driven improvements. Use this skill when establishing quality control systems for cargo operations, investigating suspected inefficiencies, or when performance problems remain unidentified despite anecdotal concerns.

# QualiCargo Performance Management System

## When to Use
- Implementing a quality control system for cargo or service operations
- Investigating operational inefficiencies in logistics networks
- Identifying hidden problems when performance is unknown or suspected to be suboptimal
- Establishing performance metrics that go beyond volume-based measurements
- Creating accountability and incentive systems for decentralized operations

## Prerequisites
- Decentralized decision-making structure
- Defined precision targets for each metric
- Data collection mechanism
- Cultural acceptance of public performance feedback
- Comparable baseline data (e.g., other stations) for benchmarking

## Part 1: Implement the QualiCargo Measurement System

### 1. Define Specific Precision Indicators
Measure performance based on these service attributes rather than volume:
- **Telephone response speed**: How quickly calls are answered
- **Deadline adherence**: Whether promised delivery times were met
- **Booking integrity**: Whether cargo arrived on the booked flight
- **Turnaround time**: Time from plane landing to cargo readiness for pickup

### 2. Publish Monthly Performance Reports
- Generate a QualiCargo diagram every month
- Compare various cargo terminals against each other
- Compare each terminal against its specific targets
- Make results visible to all stakeholders

### 3. Implement Incentive and Accountability System
- Award recognition (e.g., "star" and public praise from operations manager) to stations achieving targets
- Require stations failing targets to explain their performance
- Create transparency and motivation through public feedback

### 4. Operational Iteration
- Use data to identify previously unrecognized problems
- Change routines based on findings
- Shift resources to address identified issues
- Monitor improvement over time (e.g., on-time arrival rates from 80% to 92%)

## Part 2: Quantification-Driven Problem Identification

### 1. Data Collection
Utilize reporting systems (e.g., QualiCargo reports) to monitor specific operational metrics such as delivery time to consignees.

### 2. Quantification
Ensure data is quantified in specific units rather than anecdotal. Problems remain invisible until measured.

### 3. Comparative Analysis
Compare quantified metrics against:
- Baseline performance
- Similar entities (e.g., other stations)
- Specific targets

### 4. Problem Identification
Identify specific bottlenecks based on data deviations. Look for:
- Unusually long delivery times
- Performance significantly worse than comparable stations
- Specific process steps causing delays

### 5. Solution Formulation
Develop targeted solutions to address identified bottlenecks. Solutions may include:
- Physical changes (e.g., creating additional loading docks)
- Procedural changes
- Resource reallocation

### 6. Implementation and Monitoring
Execute the solution and track immediate performance improvements.

## Key Insight
Without quantification, problems remain invisible. As demonstrated: "Why hadn't anybody thought of that solution before? Because no one knew the problem existed."

## Constraints
- Does not apply if data cannot be quantified
- Requires a baseline for comparison to identify "slower" performance
- Requires organizational culture that accepts public performance feedback

## Key Variables
- **phone_response_time**: Time taken to answer customer calls
- **deadline_adherence**: Whether promised delivery times were met (percentage)
- **landing_to_ready_time**: Time elapsed between plane landing and cargo readiness
- **delivery_time**: Time taken to deliver cargo to consignees
- **station_performance**: Performance of a specific station relative to others
- **bottleneck_location**: The specific area causing the delay
