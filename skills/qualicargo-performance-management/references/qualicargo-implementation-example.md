# QualiCargo Implementation Example: New York Bottleneck Resolution

## Background
A cargo terminal in New York was experiencing performance issues, but the specific problem was unidentified until quantification revealed the bottleneck.

## Problem Discovery
Through QualiCargo reports, operations discovered:
- New York station was "slower than other stations"
- Delivery times to consignees were unusually long
- The problem was not visible through anecdotal observation

## Root Cause Identification
Quantified data revealed the bottleneck was:
- Insufficient loading dock capacity
- Physical constraint in the cargo terminal layout

## Solution Implemented
- "Literally knock down one of the walls in the cargo terminal"
- Created an additional loading dock
- Eliminated the physical bottleneck

## Results
- Delivery times improved immediately
- Performance converged with other stations
- Problem that had existed unnoticed was resolved

## Key Lesson
The solution was obvious once the problem was quantified. Without measurement, the bottleneck remained invisible despite its significant impact on performance.
