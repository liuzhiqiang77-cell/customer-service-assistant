# Employee Recognition and Corporate Identity

## When to Use
- Employees have gone the extra mile to achieve major organizational turnaround
- Successful completion of high-effort period (e.g., crisis recovery)
- Achievement of significant company goals
- Management seeks to improve morale
- Need to align corporate image with target market
- Budget available for employee investment

## Part 1: Two-Phase Recognition Strategy

### Phase 1: Individual Symbol of Recognition

**Components**:
- Distribute tangible gift to every employee as gratitude symbol
- Select gift symbolizing specific achievement
- Include personal letter from leadership thanking for specific contributions
- Optional: Additional benefits or reading materials

**Gift Selection Criteria**:
- Must symbolize the specific goal achieved
- Example: Wristwatch with airplane second hand = becoming world's most punctual airline
- Personal and meaningful connection to achievement

**Letter Requirements**:
- Even if pre-printed, must convey personal appreciation
- Acknowledge specific contributions
- Express genuine gratitude

### Phase 2: Joint Symbol of Recognition

**Components**:
- Organize collective event for all employees worldwide
- Include all roles and levels (mechanics, pilots, loaders, secretaries, etc.)
- Emphasize achievement was collective "group" effort, not just individual

**Event Purpose**:
- Underscore teamwork and collective success
- Allow employees to "step off the track for a breather" after crisis
- Reinforce that hearing they've done good job maintains self-respect and motivation

## Part 2: Daily Recognition Practices

### 1. Establish Daily Recognition
- Ensure employee contributions noticed daily, not just when mistakes occur
- Recognition contributes to self-esteem and on-the-job morale
- Directly impacts customer satisfaction

### 2. Administer Praise Correctly
- Ensure all praise is justified and merited
- **Critical Constraint**: Do not provide unmerited accolades
- Unmerited praise acts as insult revealing indifference

**Example of Failure**:
- Sending thank-you notes to all employees for strike relief
- Including those who did not participate
- Causes confusion and resentment

## Part 3: Corporate Identity Alignment

### 1. Align Uniforms with Market Strategy

**If Tourist Trade**:
- Outfit staff in brightly colored, sporty clothing
- Casual, approachable appearance

**If Business Traveler**:
- Opt for businesslike look with conservative styling
- Example: Dark blue fabric
- Custom design (e.g., by Calvin Klein)
- Professional, polished appearance

**Uniform Requirements**:
- Contribute to corporate image
- Can be worn proudly by staff
- Reflect target market expectations

### 2. Invest Tangibly in Employees
- Allocate significant budget to signal importance
- Example: Spending $4 million on new uniforms
- Use investment as symbol: "We are investing in you because you are important"
- Reflect investment everywhere in company
- Include daily attitude and appearance

### 3. Launch with Fanfare
- Stage simultaneous presentations in multiple locations
- Include employees, press, and government officials
- Use entertainment (live band, music)
- Use employees as models
- Create excitement and pride

## Key Variables
- **Individual_Symbol**: Gift representing specific goal achieved
- **Joint_Symbol**: Collective celebration emphasizing team unity
