# Strategic Asset & Service Realignment

## When to Use This Skill

Apply this skill when:
- The organization is suffering financial losses
- Traditional competitive advantages are being eroded
- Physical assets exist that can be reallocated
- Traditional efficiency metrics are no longer driving success

## Prerequisites

Before executing this skill, ensure:
- Financial crisis or competitive pressure exists
- The organization has physical assets that can be reallocated
- Willingness to ignore traditional efficiency metrics in favor of service metrics

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Critical Segment

Focus on identifying the primary target customer segment that will drive recovery. For airlines and service companies, this is typically the "frequent business traveler" segment.

**Actions:**
- Analyze customer data to identify high-value segments
- Determine which segment has the most urgent needs
- Validate that this segment can support profitability

### Step 2: Develop Service Product

Create specialized offerings that provide premium service at competitive rates.

**Actions:**
- Design service products specifically for the target segment
- Price strategically (e.g., first-class service at coach rates)
- Ensure the offering clearly differentiates from competitors

### Step 3: Asset Allocation - Fleet Strategy

Reallocate physical assets to better serve the target segment, prioritizing flexibility over pure efficiency.

**Actions:**
- Mothball large, efficient physical assets (e.g., Airbuses, flagship 747s)
- Retain or acquire older, less efficient fleets that provide higher frequency and flexibility
- Justify the decision based on service requirements rather than fuel efficiency

**Key Principle:** Flexibility is necessary to best serve the target customer's schedule, overriding pure efficiency metrics of larger assets.

### Step 4: Invest in Service

Allocate capital to service improvement projects even during financial losses.

**Actions:**
- Identify specific service improvement projects
- Calculate required investment (e.g., $50 million for 147 projects)
- Execute projects despite ongoing losses
- Focus on improvements that directly impact the target segment's experience

## Expected Outcomes

Successful execution should result in:
- Return to profitability (potentially within one year)
- Market leadership recognition
- Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty
- Sustainable competitive advantage through service differentiation
