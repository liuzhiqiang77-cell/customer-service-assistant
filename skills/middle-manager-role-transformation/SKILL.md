# Middle Manager Role Transformation

## When to Use
- An organization is decentralizing responsibility to front-line staff
- Middle managers are confused or hostile about their new role
- Front-line staff are being empowered with decision-making authority
- Managers are stuck in old administrative mindset or physically removed from operations

## Transformation Process

### 1. Shift Role Definition
Transform the middle manager's role from:
- **Old Role**: Issuing orders, acting as "rule interpreters," administrative control
- **New Role**: Support function for the front line, enabling others to succeed

### 2. Overcome Status Perception
- Accept that "support" and "service" are not low-status functions
- Recognize that primary value now comes from enabling others rather than administering
- Understand that authority derives from competence, not position

### 3. Execute Core Support Duties
Ensure front-line staff have:
- Clear understanding of department objectives
- Information required to meet objectives
- Resources required to meet objectives

### 4. Establish Physical Proximity
- Move manager's desk to the operational front line (e.g., arrivals terminal)
- Witness problems personally rather than making decisions remotely
- Eliminate physical separation from the work being supported

### 5. Implement Resource Negotiation Loop
1. Middle manager issues specific challenge/objective
2. Frontline accepts challenge but identifies resource gaps
3. Middle manager provides requested resources to enable completion
4. Logic: "If you want me to take on this objective, you must give me the resources"

### 6. Apply Behavioral Skills
Use these behaviors to motivate and support the front line:
- Coaching
- Informing
- Criticizing (constructively)
- Praising
- Educating

### 7. Cease Rule Enforcement
- Stop "reining in" front-line staff for breaking rules to help customers
- Allow frontline discretion in customer service situations
- Focus on outcomes rather than rule compliance

## Ultimatum Condition
If a manager cannot or will not:
- Fulfill the support role
- Witness problems personally
- Enable frontline success

Then they must yield their decision-making power to frontline staff.

## Key Variables
- **manager_location**: Physical presence (office vs. front line)
- **front_line_resources**: Whether staff has necessary info/resources
- **resource_requests**: Specific needs identified by frontline
