# Board Strategic Alignment and Empowerment

## When to Use
- Management seeks board approval for strategy
- Management needs operational autonomy
- Board currently uninformed of larger strategy
- Risk of board feeling bypassed
- Need to prevent "delegating upward" on minor decisions

## Alignment Process

### 1. Communicate the Big Picture
- Share overall business strategy and vision with Board of Directors
- Do not keep corporate visions to yourself
- Do not only dole out tidbits to look successful
- Full transparency about company direction

### 2. Focus Board on Strategy
- Ask board to participate in determining company's vision
- Enable board to focus on "overarching strategic issues"
- Prevent board from getting lost in details
- Strategic questions: "Where are we going?" not "How do we do this?"

### 3. Avoid Delegating Upward
**Do Not**:
- Ask board to approve minor decisions
- Treat board as final place to pass the buck
- Bring operational details to board for approval

**Do**:
- Make operational decisions autonomously
- Handle specific expenditures (e.g., new food carts) without returning to board
- Take responsibility for implementation

### 4. Establish Operational Autonomy
**Once board approves overall business strategy (the "What")**:
- Management authorizes specific expenditures
- Management determines operational details (the "How")
- No need to return to board for implementation decisions

**Example**:
- Board approves: "Turn around the downhill slide"
- Management decides: Spend $2 million on new food carts
- Management executes: Operational implementation

### 5. Use Board as Sounding Board
- Consult privately with board chairmen
- Double-check company's course
- Utilize collective business experience
- Do not run every detail past them
- Strategic guidance, not operational approval

## Rationale and Benefits

### Why This Matters
- Board uninformed of larger strategy cannot assess rationale behind requests
- Involving them in vision prevents feeling bypassed
- Frees board from paperwork
- Enables management autonomy
- Maintains strategic alignment

### Clear Boundaries
- **Board**: Strategy, vision, "What"
- **Management**: Operations, tactics, "How"
- **No overlap**: Board doesn't approve details, management doesn't hide strategy

## Key Variables
- **strategic_vision**: Overarching goal or direction of company
- **decision_type**: Strategic (board) vs. Operational (management)
- **approval_threshold**: What requires board approval

## Constraints
- Does not apply if management fears board
- Ineffective if used only to "pass the buck" on minor decisions
- Requires trust between management and board
- Board must be willing to focus on strategy, not details

## Expected Outcomes
- Board approves strategic goal
- Management executes specific tactics autonomously
- Board informed but not bogged down in details
- Clear strategic alignment maintained
- Management empowered to act
- Board serves as strategic partner, not operational bottleneck
