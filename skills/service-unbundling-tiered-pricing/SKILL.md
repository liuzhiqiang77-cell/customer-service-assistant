# Service Unbundling and Tiered Pricing Strategy

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- A free service is incurring significant costs
- The free service is generating customer complaints (often due to low quality)
- You have competitor pricing data for comparison
- You want to transform a cost center into a revenue stream

## Prerequisites
- Existing low-quality free service causing complaints
- Competitor pricing data (e.g., train prices, alternative transport costs)
- Ability to improve service quality

## Execution Steps

### 1. Eliminate Costly Free Service
Remove the complimentary service that is causing complaints and incurring costs.

### 2. Introduce Premium Paid Option
Launch a higher-quality service at a competitive price point relative to alternatives. Price should be:
- Competitive with alternative transport options
- Lower than competitor offerings for similar quality
- Sufficient to generate profit per serving

### 3. Capture Revenue from Premium Option
Generate profit on the premium service by ensuring:
- Cost of goods sold is lower than price
- Quality justifies the price point

### 4. Gather Customer Feedback
Listen to customers who:
- Do not want the full premium option
- Express desire for the original simple service
- Are willing to pay for a middle-tier option

### 5. Reintroduce Original as Paid Basic Option
Bring back the original items as a lower-tier paid option at a price point:
- Lower than the premium option
- Higher than the original cost (to generate profit)
- Aligned with customer willingness to pay

### 6. Validate Results
Confirm:
- Revenue has increased (previously a cost)
- Customer satisfaction has improved
- Price aligns with perceived value

## Key Variables
- **Cost of Free Service**: Annual expense of providing the complimentary item
- **Premium Price**: Price for the enhanced service
- **Basic Price**: Price for the original simple service

## Constraints
- Service quality must improve to justify cost
- Price must be competitive with alternative transport
- Cannot apply if market cannot support paid options
