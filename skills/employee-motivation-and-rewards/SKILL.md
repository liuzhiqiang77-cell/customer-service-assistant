# Employee Motivation and Rewards

## When to Use
- Organization has removed or reduced hierarchical layers
- Talented employee seeks advancement/recognition
- Employee is competent and already paid well
- Management seeks to maximize employee performance and retention
- Financial compensation is at a satisfactory level

## Core Principles

### Redefine Promotion
In flat organizations, shift the definition of "promotion" from moving up the hierarchy to receiving an assignment that provides an opportunity to accomplish something important.

**Avoid the "Hierarchy of Chest-Pocket Pens" trap:**
- If visible rank symbols (badges, medals) are removed, informal symbols will emerge naturally
- Do not let pens, office size, or other informal markers become status indicators

### Intrinsic Reward Hierarchy
The richest rewards follow this priority:
1. **Pride in work** - Employee realizes their job helps people have the "best weeks of their lives" or solves meaningful problems
2. **Self-worth** - Employee understands the value of their contribution to the end customer
3. **Well-defined responsibility** - Clear, meaningful accountability
4. **Trust** - Active trust from leadership
5. **Active interest** - Leadership shows genuine interest in their development

## Execution Steps

### For Redefining Promotion
1. Identify the limitation of old hierarchical promotions: Moving talented people from important jobs to positions of no real substance merely to increase salaries or titles
2. Grant specific rewards:
   - Well-defined responsibility
   - Trust
   - Active interest from leadership
3. Ensure the employee outcome: The employee should be able to describe their job as having influence and being "where they are needed"
4. **Prohibition**: Do not resort to empty promotions as a way of showing appreciation; this is tantamount to a confession of management failure

### For Maximizing Intrinsic Rewards
1. Establish the baseline: Ensure competent people are paid well for their contributions (financial hygiene)
2. Facilitate pride in work: Help employees see the direct positive impact on customers' lives
3. Facilitate self-worth: Help employees understand their value to the end customer
4. Provide secondary rewards: responsibility, trust, active interest
5. Implementation strategy:
   - Understand what employees want from their jobs
   - Understand their aims and development goals
   - Align tasks to allow them to "blossom and develop"

## Expected Results
- Employee feels "promoted" through increased responsibility and influence without necessarily changing job title
- Heightened employee sense of self-worth
- Increased confidence and creativity
- Healthy self-esteem generates the confidence needed to tackle new challenges
