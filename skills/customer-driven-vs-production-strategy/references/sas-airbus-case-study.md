# SAS Airbus vs. DC-9 Decision Case Study (1981)

## The Decision Context
SAS needed to decide between:
- **Airbus**: Newer, larger aircraft (240 seats)
- **DC-9**: Existing, smaller aircraft (110 seats)

## Production-Oriented Analysis

**Theoretical Efficiency:**
- Airbuses operated 6% more cheaply per passenger mile than DC-9s
- Newer technology suggested lower costs

**Required Conditions:**
- Full passenger loads required to realize savings
- Larger size (240 seats vs 110) needed high utilization

**Market Assumptions:**
- Forecasted 7-9% annual passenger load increase

## Customer-Driven Analysis

**Customer Needs Identified:**
- Scandinavian business travelers demanded frequent, nonstop flights
- Service from local cities (Stockholm/Oslo) to Continental Europe
- Convenience and timetable priority

**Operational Impact of Airbus:**
- Too big for nonstop service from smaller cities
- Economical operation required filling up in Copenhagen
- Forced stops, contradicting customer preference for nonstop flights

**Market Reality:**
- Oil crisis caused market stagnation
- Market plateaued instead of growing 7-9%

## The Decision

**Analysis:**
- Airbus offered 6% theoretical efficiency
- But forced service degradation (stops vs. nonstop)
- Market was competitive, not monopoly
- Customers valued convenience over theoretical cost savings

**Action:** "Put the Airbuses in mothballs. Use the DC-9s instead."

**Rationale:**
- Customer-driven approach prevailed
- Maintained competitive advantage through service quality
- Avoided efficiency trap that would lose customers

## Key Insight
In competitive markets, customer convenience trumps production efficiency. The 6% cost savings would be negated by customer attrition to competitors offering better schedules.
