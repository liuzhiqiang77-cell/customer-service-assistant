# Customer-Driven vs. Production-Oriented Strategy

## When to Use
Use this skill when:
- Evaluating a new investment or operational change
- Market is competitive or saturated (not monopoly)
- Product is a utility, not a novel experience
- Choosing between efficiency and customer convenience

## When NOT to Use
Do not apply when:
- Market is a monopoly (customers have no choice)
- Product is a "novel experience" rather than utility
- Early aviation/novelty phase where flying is an "event"

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of customer base needs
- Market growth forecasts
- Cost analysis of new technology/equipment

## Execution Steps

### 1. Define the Strategic Philosophies

**Production-Oriented:**
- Produce or invest in equipment/technology first
- Adapt operations to fit that equipment
- Assume newer technology = lower costs = better business

**Customer-Driven:**
- Start by discovering what customers really want
- Establish goals based on customer wants
- Adapt operations/equipment to meet those needs

### 2. Analyze the Investment

**Step A: Assess Production-Oriented Viability**
- Calculate theoretical efficiency gains
- Check required conditions for efficiency (e.g., capacity utilization)
- Verify market assumptions (growth forecasts)

**Step B: Assess Customer-Driven Viability**
- Identify specific customer needs
- Determine operational impact of new equipment on customer needs
- Evaluate market reality vs. forecasts

### 3. Execute Decision Rule

**IF** the new equipment forces a degradation of service that contradicts customer preferences in a competitive market:

**THEN** reject the production-oriented efficiency in favor of customer needs.

**Action**: Choose the option that prioritizes customer convenience over theoretical production efficiency.

### 4. Consider Historical Context

**Early Aviation/Novelty Phase:**
- Production-oriented approach was valid
- Flying was an "event" worth inconvenience
- New models brought enormous productivity gains
- Customers deferred to schedules ("flag carrier" concept)

**Modern/Utility Phase:**
- Customer-driven approach is mandatory
- Customers arrange meetings first, then book flights based on timetable
- If airline does not fit timetable, customer chooses another airline

## Key Variables
- **cost_efficiency_gain**: Theoretical reduction in operating cost per unit
- **equipment_capacity**: Capacity of new vs old equipment
- **market_growth_rate**: Forecasted or actual growth of customer base
- **customer_priority**: Primary customer driver (Novelty/Event vs Convenience/Timetable)

## Decision Template
Select the strategy that prioritizes customer convenience (e.g., frequency/nonstop) over theoretical production efficiency if the market is competitive.
